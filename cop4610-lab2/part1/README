COP4610 Lab 2 - Part1

To compile the code run 'make' from the command prompt.

The output of make will create executable files called 'part1', 'part1-sync', 'part1-inspect'.
The executable 'part1' satisfies the requirements for Step 1.1 worth 20%.
The executable 'part1-sync' satisfies the requirements for Step 1.2 worth 20%.
The executable 'part1-inspect' satisfies the requirements for Step 1.3 worth 10%.

Both execuables accept a positive integer as input. The integer is the number of threads to create.

Example for running the executables on a linux terminal:
./part1 5
./part1-sync 5
./part1-inspect 5
