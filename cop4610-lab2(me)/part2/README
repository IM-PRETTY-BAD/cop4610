COP4610 Lab 2 - Part2

To compile the code run 'make' from the command prompt.

The output of make will create an executable file called '2'.
The executable '2' satisfies the requirements for Step 2 worth 40%.

The executable accepts two positive integers as input. The first integer is the number of threads to create (these threads can be refered to as reporters). The second integer is the number of reporters allowed in the room.

Example for running the executable on a linux terminal:
./2 4 4
