Using the first-fit algorithm provided by the SLOB, we run our system
calls.
	Amount Free: 415778 bytes
	Amount Claimed: 2068 bytes
We can see the fragmentation by looking at the amount free being 
significantly higher than the amount claimed. Meaning, our system on 
average is claiming a new page needing only 2k bytes when we have 
400k bytes free. But due to the free list being fragmented, we can't 
use those free bytes.


Using our best-fit algorithm, we run our system calls.
	Amount Free: 296196 bytes
	Amount Claimed: 2241 bytes
Notice that there is still fragmentation. The amount that is free is still
much higher than the amount we are trying to allocate. But also compare 
this amount free with the first-fit's amount free. Our best-fit algorithm 
contains half the fragmentation.
