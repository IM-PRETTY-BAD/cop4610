We created a test program that calls both of our created system 
calls. We ran this test program in both implementations of the 
SLOB: best-fit and first-fit. We ran this test program several 
times until we arrived at values of 500 bytes claimed. This would be 
useful in keeping consistency.

Using the first-fit algorithm, for 500 bytes being the amount claimed, 
the first-fit SLOB had roughly 500k bytes free. We can see the 
fragmentation by looking at the amount free being significantly higher 
than the amount claimed. Meaning, our system on average is claiming a 
new page needing only 500 bytes when we have 500k bytes free. But due 
to the free list being fragmented, we can't use those free bytes.

Using our best-fit algorithm, we run our system calls. For 500 bytes 
claimed, the best-fit SLOB had roughly 300k bytes free.Notice that there 
is still fragmentation. The amount that is free is still much higher than 
the amount we are trying to allocate. But also compare this amount free 
with the first-fit's amount free. Our best-fit algorithm contains half the 
fragmentation.
