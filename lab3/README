Using the first-fit algorithm provided by the SLOB, we run our system
calls. For 500 bytes being the amount claimed, the first-fit SLOB had 
roughly 500k bytes free.

We can see the fragmentation by looking at the amount free being 
significantly higher than the amount claimed. Meaning, our system on 
average is claiming a new page needing only 500 bytes when we have 
500k bytes free. But due to the free list being fragmented, we can't 
use those free bytes.


Using our best-fit algorithm, we run our system calls. For 500 bytes 
claimed, the best-fit SLOB had roughly 300k bytes free.

Notice that there is still fragmentation. The amount that is free is still
much higher than the amount we are trying to allocate. But also compare 
this amount free with the first-fit's amount free. Our best-fit algorithm 
contains half the fragmentation.
