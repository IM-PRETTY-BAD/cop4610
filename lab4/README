TEST SCRIPT
Our test file simply reads/writes two different files: TESTFILE and TESTFILE2. 
We ran the test script and the following is our results from dmesg: 

[ 2246.016344] [CLOOK] add W 16558
[ 2246.016355] [CLOOK] add W 16542
[ 2246.016367] [CLOOK] dsp W 16542
[ 2246.016508] [CLOOK] dsp W 16558
[ 2246.016956] [CLOOK] add W 528542
[ 2246.016972] [CLOOK] dsp W 528542
[ 2246.017260] [CLOOK] add W 528574
[ 2246.017265] [CLOOK] dsp W 528574
[ 2278.016306] [CLOOK] add W 16582
[ 2278.016325] [CLOOK] add W 16654
[ 2278.016350] [CLOOK] dsp W 16574
[ 2278.016592] [CLOOK] dsp W 16654
[ 2278.017200] [CLOOK] add R 528606
[ 2278.017209] [CLOOK] dsp R 528606
[ 2278.044804] [CLOOK] add W 528582
[ 2278.044823] [CLOOK] add W 528614
[ 2278.044860] [CLOOK] dsp W 528582
[ 2278.045117] [CLOOK] dsp W 528614

You can notice several places where the adding of the request was not in 
order of physical location:
[ 2246.016344] [CLOOK] add W 16558
[ 2246.016355] [CLOOK] add W 16542
But then the requests were dispatched in the correct order:
[ 2246.016367] [CLOOK] dsp W 16542
[ 2246.016508] [CLOOK] dsp W 16558

Also, here's an example where the adding of the request was in the right
order and the dispatcher kept that order:
[ 2278.044804] [CLOOK] add W 528582
[ 2278.044823] [CLOOK] add W 528614
[ 2278.044860] [CLOOK] dsp W 528582
[ 2278.045117] [CLOOK] dsp W 528614
