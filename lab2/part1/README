Lab 2, Part 1 - COP4610
Mark Oleson & Alexis Jefferson

Run 'make' or 'make all' to compile the code.
It will create both the unsynchronized and synchronized version of the program
as 'part1' and 'part1-sync', respectively.

Each expects and will only accept one parameter, the number of threads to be
run. It also expects and will only accept that parameter if it is a valid
positive integer.
